			<h1 id="h1-t">What is ransomware?</h1>
			<p>

 <b>Ransomware</b> is a type of malicious software (aka malware) that is designed to take your computer files—and sometimes even your entire computer—hostage.

The malware encrypts your files so that they cannot be opened, or it locks you out of your computer completely to prevent access to all of those important photos, videos, accounting files, work documents, etc.
The malicious attackers responsible for sending you the malware then contacts you to demand a ransom, promising to decrypt the files after you pay (often in Bitcoin).

Ransomware is not new.
The first known attack occurred in 1989 and was spread between computers via floppy disk.
In today’s fully network-connected world, the easy access to open-source ransomware software and the strong potential for financial gain have led to a surge in ransomware’s popularity.

<h2 id="h2-t">Is ransomware a virus?</h2>
Most of us are familiar with the term virus, and we use it to refer to all forms of malware.
The truth is, a virus is just one specific type of malware.
Other common types include worms, Trojan horses, spyware, and ransomware.
The goal of each type of malware is different. Worms replicate and bog down your computer’s performance.
Viruses are designed to infect your computer, damage your files, and then spread to new hosts.
Trojan horses want to gain a secret backdoor to your computer to access and exploit your personal information.
There are numerous reasons why cyber criminals would create and distribute these types of malware.

With ransomware, the reason is usually pretty straightforward: the perpetrator wants money.
Generally speaking, the goal isn’t to permanently damage or destroy your files or even to steal your identity, but to convince you to pay for the decryption key.
